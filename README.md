### Biography

> _Unearthing rules and leveraging them are keys to success in any environment. –––Jianqing Zhang_

I am Jianqing Zhang, a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at _Shanghai Jiao Tong University_ under the supervision of [Jian Cao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=aEacdCQAAAAJ). I completed my Master's degree at the same institution under the guidance of [Ruhui Ma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=PcrtqDsAAAAJ) and [Tao Song](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=tIjK-3QAAAAJ). I earned my Bachelor's degree at _Hangzhou Dianzi University_ under the guidance of [Dongjin Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=DwG4deYAAAAJ) and [Dongjing Wang](https://dongjingwang.github.io/). My research interests include **Federated Learning**, **Transfer Learning**, and **Recommender Systems**. Both my PhD advisor and I believe that **collaboration**, which is also one of the core ideas of Federated Learning, is essential for scientific research. So far, I have worked with [Yang Liu](https://sites.google.com/site/yangliuveronica/) at _Tsinghua University_, [Yang Hua](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=N0tFi8MAAAAJ) at _Queen's University Belfast_, and [Hao Wang](https://intellisys.haow.ca/haowang/) at _Louisiana State University_. I also had the opportunity to intern at the _Machine Learning Platform - Security and Trust of ByteDance_. I am sincerely grateful for the invaluable knowledge and support from these exceptional individuals. Additionally, I am a photographer with a passion for capturing the beauty of the world.

I am always enthusiastic about the opportunity to collaborate with all of you!
